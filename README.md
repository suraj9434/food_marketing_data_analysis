*   **Product Insights:** Wine and meat products are the highest revenue drivers, particularly among high-income, childless households.

## Tools and Libraries

This analysis was conducted using **Python 3** in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The primary libraries used are:

*   **Pandas:** For data manipulation and cleaning.
*   **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
*   **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
*   **Scikit-learn:** For clustering and segmentation analysis.
